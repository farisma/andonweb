//if the timeline has already ended but the inserted tween/timeline extends the duration, we should enable this timeline again so that it renders properly. We should also align the playhead with the parent timeline's when appropriate.

//in case, for example, the _start is moved on a tween that has already rendered. Imagine it's at its end state, then the startTime is moved WAY later (after the end of this timeline), it should render at its beginning.

//in case any of the ancestors had completed but should now be enabled...

//moves the timeline (shifts its startTime) if necessary, and also enables it. If it's currently zero, though, it may not be scheduled to render until later so there's no need to force it to align with the current playhead position. Only move to catch up with the playhead.

//in case there's a child that infinitely repeats, users almost never intend for the insertion point of a new child to be based on a SUPER long value like that so we clip it and assume the most recently-added child's endTime should be used instead.

//for distributing values across an array.

//n:1 is just to indicate v was a number; we leverage that later to set v according to the length we get. If a number is passed in, we treat it like the old stagger value where 0.1, for example, would mean that things would be distributed with 0.1 between each element in the array rather than a total "amount" that's chunked out among them all.

//pass in 0.1 get a function that'll round to the nearest tenth, or 5 to round to the closest 5, or 0.001 to the closest 1000th, etc.

//to avoid floating point math errors (like 24 * 0.1 == 2.4000000000000004), we chop off at a specific number of decimal places (much faster than toFixed()

//sometimes a trailing comma is included and we should chop it off (typically from a comma-delimited list of values like a textShadow:"2px 2px 2px blue, 5px 5px 5px rgb(255,0,0)" - in this example "blue," has a trailing comma. We could strip it out inside parseComplex() but we'd need to do it to the beginning and ending values plus it wouldn't provide protection from other potential scenarios like if the user passes in a similar value.

//for shorthand like #9F0

//if relative values are found, just return the raw strings with the relative prefixes in place.

// strips out the colors from the string, finds all the numeric slots (with units) and returns an array of those. The Array also has a "c" property which is an Array of the index values where the colors belong. This is to help work around issues where there's a mis-matched order of color/numeric data like drop-shadow(#f00 0px 1px 2px) and drop-shadow(0x 1px 2px #f00). This is basically a helper function used in _formatColors()

//name can be a string like "elastic.out(1,0.5)", and pass in _easeMap as obj and it'll parse it out and call the actual function like _easeMap.Elastic.easeOut.config(1,0.5). It will also parse custom ease strings as long as CustomEase is loaded and registered (internally as _easeMap._CE).

//takes a string like "{wiggles:10, type:anticipate})" and turns it into a real object. Notice it ends in ")" and includes the {} wrappers. This is because we only use this function for parsing ease configs and prioritized optimization rather than reusability.

//in case any of the ancestor timelines had completed but should now be enabled, we should reset their totalTime() which will also ensure that they're lined up properly and enabled. Skip for animations that are on the root (wasteful). Example: a TimelineLite.exportRoot() is performed when there's a paused tween on the root, the export will not complete until that tween is unpaused, but imagine a child gets restarted later, after all [unpaused] tweens have completed. The start of that child would get pushed out, but one of the ancestors may have completed.

// if (!parent._dp && parent._time === parent._dur) { // if a root timeline completes...and then a while later one of its children resumes, we must shoot the playhead forward to where it should be raw-wise, otherwise the child will jump to the end. Down side: this assumes it's using the _ticker.time as a reference.

// 	parent._time = _ticker.time - parent._start;

// }

//for performance improvement. If the parent's cache is already dirty, it already took care of marking the ancestors as dirty too, so skip the function call here.

//if the animation doesn't have a parent, put it back into its last parent (recorded as _dp for exactly cases like this). Limit to parents with autoRemoveChildren (like globalTimeline) so that if the user manually removes an animation from a timeline and then alters its playhead, it doesn't get added back in.

// otherwise, if an animation is paused, then the playhead is moved back to zero, then resumed, it'd revert back to the original time at the pause

// note: if the modulus results in 0, the playhead could be exactly at the end or the beginning, and we always defer to the END with a non-zero value, otherwise if you set the time() to the very end (duration()), it would render at the START!

// recorded timeScale. Special case: if someone calls reverse() on an animation with timeScale of 0, we assign it -_tinyNum to remember it's reversed.

// make sure to do the parentToChildTotalTime() BEFORE setting the new _ts because the old one must be used in that calculation.

// prioritize rendering where the parent's playhead lines up instead of this._tTime because there could be a tween that's animating another tween's timeScale in the same rendering loop (same parent), thus if the timeScale tween renders first, it would alter _start BEFORE _tTime was set on that tick (in the rendering loop), effectively freezing it until the timeScale tween finishes.

// _ts is the functional timeScale which would be 0 if the animation is paused.

//sometimes we must force a re-sort of all children and update the duration/totalDuration of all ancestor timelines immediately in case, for example, in the middle of a render loop, one tween alters another tween's timeScale which shoves its startTime before 0, forcing the parent timeline to shift around and shiftChildren() which could affect that next tween's render (startTime). Doesn't matter for the root timeline though.

// if the pause occurs during the delay phase, make sure that's factored in when resuming.

//only defer to _pTime (pauseTime) if tTime is zero. Remember, someone could pause() an animation, then scrub the playhead and resume(). If the parent doesn't have smoothChildTiming, we render at the rawTime() because the startTime won't get updated.

// _dp = detatched parent

// globalTime(rawTime) {

// 	let animation = this,

// 		time = arguments.length ? rawTime : animation.rawTime();

// 	while (animation) {

// 		time = animation._start + time / (animation._ts || 1);

// 		animation = animation.parent;

// 	return time;

//ONLY for backward compatibility! Maybe delete?

//if totalDuration() finds a child with a negative startTime and smoothChildTiming is true, things get shifted around internally so we need to adjust the time accordingly. For example, if a tween starts at -30 we must shift EVERYTHING forward 30 seconds and move this timeline's startTime backward by 30 seconds so that things align with the playhead (no jump).

//when the playhead arrives at EXACTLY time 0 (right on top) of a zero-duration timeline, we need to discern if events are suppressed so that when the playhead moves again (next time), it'll trigger the callback. If events are NOT suppressed, obviously the callback would be triggered in this render. Basically, the callback should fire either when the playhead ARRIVES or LEAVES this exact spot, not both. Imagine doing a timeline.seek(0) and there's a callback that sits at 0. Since events are suppressed on that seek() by default, nothing will fire, but when the playhead moves off of that position, the callback should fire. This behavior is what people intuitively expect.

        would get translated to 2.8 seconds if the timeline yoyos or 0.2 seconds if it just repeats), there
        could be a callback or a short tween that's at 2.95 or 3 seconds in which wouldn't render. So
        we need to push the timeline to the end (and/or beginning depending on its yoyo value). Also we must
        ensure that zero-duration tweens at the very beginning or end of the Timeline work.

// an extreme edge case - the child's render could do something like kill() the "next" one in the linked list, or reparent it. In that case we must re-initiate the whole render to be safe.

//in case a tween pauses or seeks the timeline when rendering, like inside of an onUpdate/onComplete

// it didn't finish rendering, so flag zTime as negative so that so that the next time render() is called it'll be forced (to render any remaining children)

//when the playhead goes backward beyond the start of this timeline, we must pass that information down to the child animations so that zero-duration tweens know whether to render their starting or ending values.

// it didn't finish rendering, so adjust zTime so that so that the next time render() is called it'll be forced (to render any remaining children)

//the callback resumed playback! So since we may have held back the playhead due to where the pause is positioned, go ahead and jump to where it's SUPPOSED to be (if no pause happened).

//if the pause was at an earlier time and the user resumed in the callback, it could reposition the timeline (changing its startTime), throwing things off slightly, so we make sure the _start doesn't shift.

// don't remove if the timeline is reversed and the playhead isn't at 0, otherwise tl.progress(1).reverse() won't work. Only remove if the playhead is at the end and timeScale is positive, or if the playhead is at 0 and the timeScale is negative.

//don't allow a timeline to be added to itself as a child!

//special case for the global timeline (or any other that has no parent or detached parent).

//in case the user had an onStart in the vars - we don't want to overwrite it.

//record it here in case the tween changes position in the sequence...

//in case one of the tweens shifted out of order, it needs to be re-inserted into the correct position in the sequence

//prevent endless recursive calls - there are methods that get triggered that check duration/totalDuration when we add().

//children aren't allowed to have negative startTimes unless smoothChildTiming is true, so adjust here if one is found.

//note: we call _addComplexStringPropTween.call(tweenInstance...) to ensure that it's scoped properly. We may call it from within a plugin too, thus "this" would refer to the plugin.

//ensure values are strings

//pass an array with the starting and ending values and let the filter do whatever it needs to the values.

//these nested PropTweens are handled in a special way - we'll never actually call a render or setter method on them. We'll just loop through them in the parent complex string PropTween's render method.

//note: SVG spec allows omission of comma/space when a negative sign is wedged between two numbers, like 2.5-5.3 instead of 2.5,-5.3 but when tweening, the negative value may switch to positive, so we insert the comma just in case.

//start the linked list with this new PropTween. Remember, we call _addComplexStringPropTween.call(tweenInstance...) to ensure that it's scoped properly. We may call it from within a plugin too, thus "this" would refer to the plugin.

//we use the "c" of the PropTween to store the final part of the string (after the last number)

//note: we can't use tween._ptLookup[index] because for staggered tweens, the index from the fullTargets array won't match what it is in each individual tween that spawns from the stagger.

//store a reference temporarily so we can avoid overwriting itself.

//there must have been a parent timeline with yoyo:true that is currently in its yoyo phase, so flip the eases.

//if there's an internal timeline, skip all the parsing because we passed that task down the chain.

//copy the properties/values into a new object to avoid collisions, like var to = {x:0}, from = {x:500}; timeline.fromTo(e, from, to).fromTo(e, to, from);

//tweens that render immediately (like most from() and fromTo() tweens) shouldn't revert when their parent timeline's playhead goes backward past the startTime because the initial render could have happened anytime and it shouldn't be directly correlated to this tween's startTime. Imagine setting up a complex animation where the beginning states of various objects are rendered immediately but the tween doesn't happen for quite some time - if we revert to the starting values as soon as the playhead goes backward past the tween's startTime, it will throw things off visually. Reversion should only happen in Timeline instances where immediateRender was false or when autoRevert is explicitly set to true.

//we skip initialization here so that overwriting doesn't occur until the tween actually begins. Otherwise, if you create several immediateRender:true tweens of the same target/properties to drop into a Timeline, the last one created would overwrite the first ones because they didn't get placed into the timeline yet before the first render occurs and kicks in overwriting.

//from() tweens must be handled uniquely: their beginning values must be rendered but we don't want overwriting to occur yet (when time is still 0). Wait until the tween actually begins before doing all the routines like overwriting. At that time, we should render at the END of the tween to ensure that things initialize correctly (remember, from() tweens go backwards)

//in rare cases (like if a from() tween runs and then is invalidate()-ed), immediateRender could be true but the initial forced-render gets skipped, so there's no need to force the render in this context when the _time is greater than 0

//we tag the tween with as "isFromStart" so that if [inside a plugin] we need to only do something at the very END of a tween, we have a way of identifying this tween as merely the one that's setting the beginning values for a "from()" tween. For example, clearProps in CSSPlugin should only get applied at the very END of a tween and without this tag, from(...{height:100, clearProps:"height", delay:1}) would wipe the height at the beginning of the tween and after 1 second, it'd kick back in.

//zero-duration tweens render immediately by default, but if we're not specifically instructed to render this tween immediately, we should skip this and merely _init() to record the starting values (rendering them immediately would push them to completion which is wasteful in that case - we'd have to render(-1) immediately after)

//ensures that the initial values are recorded

//someone may need to specify CSS-specific values AND non-CSS values, like if the element has an "x" property plus it's a standard DOM element. We allow people to distinguish by wrapping plugin-specific stuff in a css:{} object for example.

//Also make sure the overwriting doesn't overwrite THIS tween!!!

//plugins like RoundProps must wait until ALL of the PropTweens are instantiated. In the plugin's init() function, it sets the _onInit on the tween instance. May not be pretty/intuitive, but it's fast and keeps file size down.

//nested timelines should never run backwards - the backwards-ness is in the child tweens.

//PropTween lookup. An array containing an object for each target, having keys for each tweening property

//users can pass in callbacks like onStart/onComplete in the stagger object. These should fire with each individual tween.

//so that propagation works properly when a ancestor timeline yoyos

//don't just copy duration or delay because if they're a string or function, we'd end up in an infinite loop because _isFuncOrString() would evaluate as true in the child tweens, entering this loop, etc. So we parse the value straight from vars and default to 0.

// if someone does delay:"random(1, 5)", repeat:-1, for example, the delay shouldn't be inside the repeat.

//speed optimization, faster lookups (no going up the prototype chain)

//forces a render without having to set the render() "force" parameter to true because we want to allow lazying by default (using the "force" parameter always forces an immediate full render)

//this senses if we're crossing over the start time, in which case we must record _zTime and force the render, but we do it in this lengthy conditional way for performance reasons (usually we can skip the calculations): this._initted && (this._zTime < 0) !== (totalTime < 0)

// the tDur === tTime is for edge cases where there's a lengthy decimal on the duration and it may reach the very end but the time is rendered as not-quite-there (remember, tDur is rounded to 4 decimals whereas dur isn't)

//could be during the repeatDelay part. No need to render and fire callbacks.

//timeline && this._yEase && _propagateYoyoEase(timeline, isYoyo);

//repeatRefresh functionality

//force, otherwise if lazy is true, the _attemptInitTween() will return and we'll jump out and get caught bouncing on each tick.

// in constructor if immediateRender is true, we set _tTime to -_tinyNum to have the playhead cross the starting point but we can't leave _tTime as a negative number.

// while initting, a plugin like InertiaPlugin might alter the duration, so rerun from the start to ensure everything renders as it should.

// don't remove if we're rendering at exactly a time of 0, as there could be autoRevert values that should get set on the next tick (if the playhead goes backward beyond the startTime, negative totalTime). Don't remove if the timeline is reversed and the playhead isn't at 0, otherwise tl.progress(1).reverse() won't work. Only remove if the playhead is at the end and timeScale is positive, or if the playhead is at 0 and the timeScale is negative.

// See https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2369

//if units change, we need a way to render the original unit/value when the tween goes all the way back to the beginning (ratio:0)

//some servers swap in https for http in the namespace which can break things, making "style" inaccessible.

//some environments won't allow access to the element's style when created with a namespace in which case we default to the standard createElement() to work around the issue. Also note that when GSAP is embedded directly inside an SVG file, createElement() won't allow access to the style object in Firefox (see https://greensock.com/forums/topic/20215-problem-using-tweenmax-in-standalone-self-containing-svg-file-err-cannot-set-property-csstext-of-undefined/).

//css variables may not need caps swapped out for dashes and lowercase.

//make sure to override certain properties that may contaminate measurements, in case the user has overreaching style sheets.

//works around issues in some browsers (like Firefox) that don't correctly report getBBox() on SVG elements inside a <defs> element and/or <mask>. We try creating an SVG, adding it to the documentElement and toss the element in there so that it's definitely part of the rendering tree, then grab the bbox and if it works, we actually swap out the original getBBox() method for our own that does these extra steps whenever getBBox is needed. This helps ensure that performance is optimal (only do all these extra steps when absolutely necessary...most elements don't need it).

//store the original

//Firefox throws errors if you try calling getBBox() on an SVG element that's not rendered (like in a <symbol> or <defs>). https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=612118

//some browsers (like Firefox) misreport the bounds if the element has zero width and height (it just assumes it's at x:0, y:0), thus we need to manually grab the position in that case.

//reports if the element is an SVG on which getBBox() actually works

//Microsoft and some Webkit browsers don't conform to the standard of capitalizing the first prefix character, so we adjust so that when we prefix the caps with a dash, it's correct (otherwise it'd be "ms-transform" instead of "-ms-transform" for IE9, for example)

//note: old versions of IE use "removeAttribute()" instead of "removeProperty()"

//takes a single value like 20px and converts it to the unit specified, like "%", returning only the numeric amount.

// some browsers leave extra whitespace at the beginning of CSS variables, hence the need to trim()

// like for borderRadius, if it's a % we must have it relative to the target itself but that may not have position: relative or position: absolute in which case it'd go up the chain until it finds its offsetParent (bad). position: static protects against that.

//note: we call _tweenComplexCSSString.call(pluginInstance...) to ensure that it's scoped properly. We may call it from within a plugin too, thus "this" would refer to the plugin.

// some browsers like Safari actually PREFER the prefixed property and mis-report the unprefixed value like clipPath (BUG). In other words, even though clipPath exists in the style ("clipPath" in target.style) and it's set in the CSS properly (along with -webkit-clip-path), Safari reports clipPath as "none" whereas WebkitClipPath reports accurately like "ellipse(100% 0% at 50% 0%)", so in this case we must SWITCH to using the prefixed property instead. See https://greensock.com/forums/topic/18310-clippath-doesnt-work-on-ios/

//pass an array with the starting and ending values and let the filter do whatever it needs to the values. If colors are found, it returns true and then we must match where the color shows up order-wise because for things like boxShadow, sometimes the browser provides the computed values with the color FIRST, but the user provides it with the color LAST, so flip them if necessary. Same for drop-shadow().

//if something like "perspective:300" is passed in and we must add a unit to the end

//start the linked list with this new PropTween. Remember, we call _tweenComplexCSSString.call(pluginInstance...) to ensure that it's scoped properly. We may call it from within another plugin too, thus "this" would refer to the plugin.

// force all the cached values back to "normal"/identity, otherwise if there's another tween that's already set to render transforms on this element, it could display the wrong values.

//ensures that even complex values like "translate(50,60) rotate(135,0,0)" are parsed because it mashes it into a matrix.

//note: if offsetParent is null, that means the element isn't in the normal document flow, like if it has display:none or one of its ancestors has display:none). Firefox returns null for getComputedStyle() if the element is in an iframe that has display:none. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548397

//browsers don't report transforms accurately unless the element is in the DOM and has a display value that's not "none". Firefox and Microsoft browsers have a partial bug where they'll report transforms even if display:none BUT not any percentage-based values like translate(-50%, 8px) will be reported as if it's translate(0, 8px).

//flag

//if it's zero (like if scaleX and scaleY are zero), skip it to avoid errors with dividing by zero.

//otherwise, if someone sets  an origin via CSS, it will likely interfere with the SVG transform attribute ones (because remember, we're baking the origin into the matrix() value).

//for handling transformOrigin values, stripping out the 3rd dimension

//for handling cases where someone passes in a whole transform string, like transform: "scale(2, 3) rotate(20deg) translateY(30em)"

//%-based translations will fail unless we set the width/height to match the original target (and padding/borders can affect it)

//tweening to no perspective gives very unintuitive results - just keep the same perspective in that case.

// handle splitting apart padding, margin, borderWidth, and borderRadius into their 4 components. Firefox, for example, won't report borderRadius correctly - it will only do borderTopLeftRadius and the other corners. We also want to handle paddingTop, marginLeft, borderRightWidth, etc.

// getter, passed target, property, and unit (from _get())

//CSS variable

//--- TRANSFORM-RELATED ---

//special case where we control the visibility along with opacity. We still allow the opacity value to pass through and get tweened.

//if visibility is initially set to "hidden", we should interpret that as intent to make opacity 0 (a convenience)

// if, for example, gsap.set(... {transform:"translateX(50vw)"}), the _get() call doesn't parse the transform, thus cache.renderTransform won't be set yet so force the parsing of the transform here.

//the first time through, create the rendering PropTween so that it runs LAST (in the linked list, we keep adding to the beginning)

//the user provided them in the wrong order, so flip them

//in case something like "left top" or "bottom right" is passed in. Convert to percentages.

//handle the zOrigin separately!

// protect against NaN

//when the tween goes all the way back to the beginning, we need to revert it to the OLD/ORIGINAL value (with those units). We record that as a "b" (beginning) property and point to a render method that handles that. (performance optimization)

//maybe it's not a style - it could be a property added directly to an element in which case we'll try to animate that.

//returns a setter function that accepts target, property, value and applies it accordingly. Remember, properties like "x" aren't as simple as target.style.property = value because they've got to be applied to a proxy object and then merged into a transform string in a renderer.
